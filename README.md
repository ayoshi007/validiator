# Validiator
A data validation and serializing library for converting JSON to and from Python dataclasses.

Written with no dependencies.

The primary purpose is to validate, serialize, and deserialize Python dictionaries/lists as valid JSON. As such, Python data structures such as sets and tuples, which are not a part of the JSON spec, are not supported.
