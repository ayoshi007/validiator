# Validiator
A data validation and JSON serializing library written with no dependencies, in pure Python

The primary purpose is to validate, serialize, and deserialize Python dictionaries/lists as valid JSON. As such, Python data structures such as sets and tuples, which are not a part of the JSON spec, are not supported.
